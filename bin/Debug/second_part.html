  <body style = "background-color:lemonchiffon">
  <p>While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.</p>
  <p>She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?</p>
  <p>Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.</p>
  <p>Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.</p>
  <p>But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.</p>
  <p>The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.</p>
  <p>Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.</p>
  <p>Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.</p>
  <p>Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.</p>
  <p>He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.</p>
  <p>The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.</p>
  <p>The watched him go into his house.</p>
  <p>And then they crept up to the window to listen.</p>
  <p>Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.</p>
  <p>They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle—</p>
  <p>"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!" said Mr. McGregor.</p>
  <p>"Eh? What’s that? What have they been spoiling now?" enquired Mrs. McGregor.</p>
  <p>"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers—"one, two, three—"</p>
  <p>"Don’t you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?"</p>
  <p>"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!" replied Mr. McGregor.</p>
  <p>(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)</p>
  <p>Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.</p>
  <p>"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak."</p>
  <p>"Line your old cloak?" shouted Mr. McGregor—"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!"</p>
  <p>"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads."</p>
  <p>Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.</p>
  <p>When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had "done it a purpose."</p>
  <p>And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.</p>
  <p>It was rather hurt.</p>
  <p>Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.</p>
  <p>So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.</p>
  <p>But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.</p>
